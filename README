This is a private URL shortener, designed for use within an office network
environment to share bookmarks between colleagues.

It has no internal security, so don't deploy it on a publicly-facing host
unless you want mean people to delete all your links and/or rewrite them to
point to awful things.

Configuration is handled entirely via environment variables:

BOUNCER_DB_PATH -> path for the SQLite DB holding all app state
BOUNCER_PORT    -> port number for the web UI
BOUNCER_DEBUG   -> if set, will enable Flask debugging for nice stack traces
                   (and even *less* security than normal!)

To initialize the database schema, use a command like the following:

BOUNCER_DB_PATH=/var/db/bouncer.db bouncer-initdb

Then run the server like this:

BOUNCER_DB_PATH=/var/db/bouncer.db bouncerd
